# Templates

In this folder you find ready to copy-paste templates of open source projects together with their dependencies.

## Change passwords

The templates come with default users and passwords. Change them before deploying so your app is secure.

## Your app template

There is also one template that you can use as [base to deploy your own image](/.yourApp.yml) in Docker Deploy.
